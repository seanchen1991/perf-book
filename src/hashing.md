# Hashing

`HashSet` and `HashMap` are two widely-used types. The default hashing
algorithm is not specified, but at the time of writing the default is an
algorithm called [SipHash 1-3]. This algorithm is high quality—it provides high
protection against collisions—but is relatively slow, particularly for short keys
such as integers.

If profiling shows that hashing is hot, and [HashDoS attacks] are not a concern
for your application, the use of hash tables with faster hash algorithms can
provide large speed wins.
- [`fxhash`] provides `FxHashSet` and `FxHashMap` types that are drop-in
  replacements for `HashSet` and `HashMap`. Its hashing algorithm is
  low-quality but very fast, especially for integer keys, and has been found to
  out-perform all other hash algorithms within rustc.
- [`fnv`] provides `FnvHashSet` and `FnvHashMap` types. Its hashing algorithm
  is higher quality than `fxhash`'s but a little slower.
- [`ahash`] provides `AHashSet` and `AHashMap`. Its hashing algorithm can take
  advantage of AES hardware on Intel processors.

If hashing performance is important in your program, it is worth trying more
than one of these alternatives. For example, the following results were seen in
rustc.
- The switch from `fnv` to `fxhash` gave
  [speed-ups of up to 6%](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/37229/commits/00e48affde2d349e3b3bfbd3d0f6afb5d76282a7).
- An attempt to switch from `fxhash` to `ahash` resulted in
  [slow-downs of 1-4%](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/69153#issuecomment-589504301).
- An attempt to switch from `fxhash` back to the default hasher resulted in
  [slow-downs ranging from 4-84%](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/69153#issuecomment-589338446)!

If you decide to universally use one of the alternatives, such as
`FxHashSet`/`FxHashMap`, it is easy to accidentally use `HashSet`/`HashMap` in
some places. The presence of `SipHasher13` code in profiles is a tell-tale
indicator of this.

Hash function design is a complex topic and is beyond the scope of this book.
The [`ahash` documentation] has a good discussion.
